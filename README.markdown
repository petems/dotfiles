# PeteMS does dotfiles

## dotfiles

My dotfile customisations, forked from https://github.com/holman/dotfiles

## install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/petems/dotfiles.git ~/Projects/dotfiles
cd ~/Projects/dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

## forks and stuff

If you want to fork this, feel free! But if it breaks my stuff maybe not...

## thanks

@holman for making the original project, and @pvdb for showing me some neat tricks with the SBRC dotfiles project. I hope one day he can open-source it, as it's pretty rad! :)
